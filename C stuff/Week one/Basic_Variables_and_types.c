//In C we have to declare variables. Variables are pieces of information that help keep track of informaton while a program is running

int main(void){
    int position;
    position = 10; //variable initialization//Can also be done as int position=10;

    printf("position: %d\n", position);

    return 0;
}
//int is the type of variable while position is the name of the variable. Meaning position is going to store int values(integers without decimal points)
//Position acts as a place to store values int position is callled variable declaration
//When we give the variable its first variable we call that variable initalization.
